# Threat-Analysis-for-Smart-Cities
## Introduction
A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a mixed system integrated with computation, communication, and physical processes, which takes an important position in the smart city, and there are many challenges in its security issues. Firstly, we establish a cybersecurity model for CPS, providing the security threats of various components of CPS. Then, we propose a CPS threat analysis method and provide experimental test results. The results show that this method can achieve rapid, large-scale security threat modeling and automatic analysis. Consequently, it can provide technical support for the security assurance of the key information infrastructures in smart cities. Finally, we summarized the research advances and future research directions for security threats on CPS in smart cities. For more details, please refer to http://www.c-s-a.org.cn/html/2018/7/6453.html. In this project, we established a testbed and a mini-UI system to verify our CPS threat analysis method and auto-anomaly detection algorithm.
